What 10 things have you stopped doing in your life?

1.Buying the latest phone model. I now wait until mine is truly fucked up and too slow to rely on. As long as the camera is still good and can make phone calls and send text, i’m all good, baby!
2.Faking smiles and niceties ad nauseam. If i don’t vibe with somebody because they are toxic to me, I don’t bother being all friendly. I will stop hanging out with them. I moved out of my last apartment because my roommates were toxic.
